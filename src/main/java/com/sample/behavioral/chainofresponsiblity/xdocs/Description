Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. 
Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

PROBLEM ::
The problem statement is to design a system for support service system consisting of front desk, 
supervisor, manager and director. Any client can call to front desk and will ask for a solution. 
If front desk is able to solve the issue, it will; otherwise will pass to supervisor. Similarly, 
supervisor will try to solve the issue and if he is able to then he will solve; else pass to manager. 
Same way, manager will either solve the issue or pass to director. Director will either solve the issue or reject it.

SOLUTION ::

Support desk > supervisor > manager > director
