Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains 
all information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, 
delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

PROBLEM ::
Suppose we need to build a remote control for home automation system which shall control different 
lights/electrical units of the home. A single button in remote may be able to perform same operation on similar devices 
e.g. a TV ON/OFF button can be used to turn ON/OFF different TV set in different rooms.
