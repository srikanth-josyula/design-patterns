Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

PROBLEM ::

1. Imagine that you’re creating a stock market monitoring app. The app downloads the stock data from multiple sources in XML format 
	and then displays nice-looking charts and diagrams for the user.
2. At some point, you decide to improve the app by integrating a smart 3rd-party analytics library. 
	But there’s a catch: the analytics library only works with data in JSON format.
	
SOLUTION ::

1. You can create an adapter. This is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it.
2. An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes. The wrapped object isn’t even aware of the adapter.
