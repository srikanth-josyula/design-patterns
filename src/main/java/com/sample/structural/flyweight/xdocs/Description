Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM 
by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.

PROBELM ::

1. Suppose we have a pen which can exist with/without refill. A refill can be of any color thus a 
	pen can be used to create drawings having N number of colors.
2. Here Pen can be flyweight object with refill as extrinsic attribute. 
	All other attributes such as pen body, pointer etc. can be intrinsic attributes which will be common to all pens. 
	A pen will be distinguished by its refill color only, nothing else.

3. All application modules which need to access a red pen â€“ can use the same instance of red pen (shared object). 
 	Only when a different color pen is needed, application module will ask for another pen from flyweight factory.
